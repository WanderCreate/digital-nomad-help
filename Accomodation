Accommodation

    [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) - Used a lot by digital nomads, very good especially when booking a stay of a month or longer. Beware of cleaning fees and additional fees when budgeting..
   
    [Hostelworld](https://www.hostelworld.com/) - Budget accommodation for nomads that prefer a more social environment or need to keep costs down.
    [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) - For staying one or few nights in a new city, last minute arrangements, usually free. Good for meeting locals.
    [Coliving](https://coliving.com/) - For living with other nomads or people with similar interests.
    [Booking](https://www.booking.com/) - lots of filters, different types of accomodation, good prices and choices. 
    [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/)  - Best for Southeast Asia.

If you are interested in local culture, helping out, and living in someone's home, you can try out work+stay experiences.
[Workaway](https://www.workaway.info/) One of the biggest sites. Free to browse hosts, need to pay to contact them and arrange stays.
[Helpx](https://www.helpx.net/) similar to Workaway, though the design of the website is a bit clunkier, and prices are different.
[WWOOF](https://wwoof.net/) focused on organic farms and similar stays. Need to buy membership for each country you want to stay in.
